All the code developed for the Computational Intelligence course held by Professor Giovanni Squillero at Politecnico di Torino.


## Laboratory 0: Set covering

Resolved with A* search to find the solution with the least amount of sets possible. The heuristic function is the number of uncovered elements. The cost function is the number of sets used.

## Halloween Challenge

A challenge on single state methods proposed by Squillero for the Halloween weekend. The summary contains a few of the information that are found in the more complete notebook.

## Laboratory 2: Nim 

> Not completed in time

I want to complete this laboratory in the future, but I didn't have the time to do it before the deadline. 

## Laboratory 9: Genetic Algorithms

Done in collaboration with @giovanni-violo

Write a local-search algorithm (eg. an EA) able to solve the *Problem* instances 1, 2, 5, and 10 on a 1000-loci genomes, using a minimum number of fitness calls.
