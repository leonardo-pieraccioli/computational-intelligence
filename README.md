## Laboratory 0: Set covering

Resolved with A* search to find the solution with the least amount of sets possible. The heuristic function is the number of uncovered elements. The cost function is the number of sets used.

## Halloween Challenge

A challenge on single state methods proposed by Squiller for the Halloween weekend. The summary contains a few of the information that are found in the more complete notebook.
